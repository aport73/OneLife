    desc: From the Western Deserts come the Katari, cat-folk who have arrived in Teramith. Being at home in the desert, it is the desert biome that they have claimed for themselves. The Katari are naturally more agile, as well.

    desc: From the Coral Ocean come the Zora, fish-folk who now also live in the waters around Teramith. Zora can breathe underwater and very fast swimmers, but on land they are slow and awkward. They also have good vision underwater and glean sea resources easier.
